# Learn-Oceanography-With-Me
### About: 
This is a work in progress repository where ocean lovers alike can come and share knowledge wiki style. While it is in its early stages there will be plenty of gaps in information. 

Since this is a community lead repository starting with one person (hello!) there may be errors or basic level information supplied. If you notice an error please send in an issue, each will be resolved as soon as possible.

Otherwise if you have knowledge you are keen to share feel free to fork this repository and send in a pull request when you are satisfied with your additions. There are no skill level requirements here, you just need to have an interest in whichever branch of oceanography you so desire.
